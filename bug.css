The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascade.  The unexpected behavior arises from the interaction between the `id` selector and the class selector, in combination with inheritance.

```css
#container {
  color: blue;
}

.text {
  color: red;
}

#container .text {
  color: green; /* This rule should override the others, but doesn't always behave as expected */
}

#container p {
  color: purple; /* Inherits color from #container, but interaction with .text might be unpredictable */
}
```

In this example, the `<p>` element within the `#container` div might unexpectedly inherit the `color: blue` from `#container`, ignoring the cascade that should prioritize the more specific `#container .text` rule, especially if `.text` is applied to the paragraph after the paragraph is defined.  This can lead to confusion and inconsistent styling.
