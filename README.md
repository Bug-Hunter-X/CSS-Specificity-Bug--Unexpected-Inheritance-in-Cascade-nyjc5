# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Inheritance

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS specificity and inheritance. The bug showcases a scenario where a seemingly more specific CSS rule fails to override a less specific one due to unexpected inheritance behavior.  This is particularly noticeable when dealing with class selectors and ID selectors in combination with the inheritance of properties.

## Bug Description

The core issue lies in the interaction between the cascade and inheritance.  A highly specific rule (e.g., `#container .text`) might not effectively override a less specific rule (e.g., `#container`) if the inheritance of properties creates unexpected behavior, particularly if the rules are applied at different stages or times.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code.  The unexpected behavior is often related to the order of CSS declarations.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file presents a solution to address this unexpected behavior.  The solution aims to enforce the intended cascade order explicitly by adjusting the selector combinations or improving the CSS structuring in such a manner as to clarify inheritance.
